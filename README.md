# bPermissions repo

## What is it
bPermissions Enterprise Edition is an efficient and dynamic rethink of the permissions concept, targeted at the server-network, rather than the server.

## Features
This branch of bPermissions comes with full MySQL support, as well as the option of global, or per world permissions in one handy package.
