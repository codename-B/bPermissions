Version 3.0 of bPermissions brings a lot of new and exciting features.

bPermissions 3.0 is coded from scratch. It doesn't use any of the 2.x features. Brand new, coded for scratch and aimed more at big and professional servers!

For now we do not have too much to say about the project other than you will love it. More information will come here on the page. If you have any interesting ideas open a ticket or send in a pull request.

The 2.x project will still be available and updated to the latest builds and still be up to date like normal. This project will now be lead by a fellow developer, rymate1234. He will be an Author of the project page. A new project will be made for bPermissions 3.0 because of the vast changes in coding and structure.
